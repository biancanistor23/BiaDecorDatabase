# Bia Decor Database with MySQL Server

## Technologies and Concepts Used

1. **MySQL Server**: Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with MySQL Server. I learned how to set up and manage databases, create tables, define relationships between them, and execute SQL queries to interact with the database.

2. **Relational Database Design**: I learned the principles of relational database design, understanding the importance of defining tables, establishing relationships using foreign keys, and ensuring data integrity with constraints like primary keys. This knowledge enabled me to structure the database effectively.

3. **SQL Queries**: Working with SQL queries allowed me to manipulate data within the database efficiently. I learned how to write queries to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data, as well as perform various operations to analyze and manage the database effectively.

4. **Stored Procedures**: Exploring stored procedures enhanced my understanding of encapsulating business logic within the database. I learned how to create reusable code blocks to streamline common tasks, improve modularity, and simplify maintenance of the database.

5. **Views**: Implementing views provided insights into abstracting complex query logic and presenting data in a simplified format. I learned how to define virtual tables that encapsulate specific data subsets, facilitating easier querying and enhancing data presentation for application consumption.

6. **Cursor-Based Operations**: Understanding cursor-based operations allowed me to iterate through query result sets programmatically within stored procedures. I learned how to use cursors to process rows individually, enabling more granular data manipulation and enforcing business rules effectively.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Throughout the project, I explored techniques for optimizing database performance. I learned about indexing strategies, minimizing network traffic through stored procedures, and optimizing SQL queries to improve query execution efficiency, enhancing overall database performance.
